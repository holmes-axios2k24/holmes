DataQuest - Round 3
--------------------

Welcome to Axios 2024 - DataQuest. The likelihood of a previously convicted individual to re-offend, is a critical issue in the criminal justice system. To reduce this rates, it is essential to identify the key factors influencing re-offending and develop robust models that can predict the likelihood of re-offending for individuals. This competition invites data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and students to help develop models that predict whether an individual will re-offend within three years after being released or not.
